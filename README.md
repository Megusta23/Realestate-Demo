# Real Estate Demo Application

## Why I Created It

This project was created as a **learning exercise** to explore and understand modern web development practices. At the time of development, it served as a practical way to learn:

- Building full-stack applications with Next.js
- State management and component architecture with React
- UI development with Chakra UI
- API integration with Axios
- Real-time data fetching and display

**⚠️ Important Note:** This codebase is **quite old** and uses outdated versions of several libraries. **It will not run with current/modern versions** of the dependencies due to breaking changes and deprecated features in later releases of:

- React (currently on v19, this uses v17)
- Next.js (currently on v16+, this was built for earlier versions)
- Chakra UI and other component libraries that have undergone significant API changes

This repository is maintained as a historical reference and learning artifact, not as a production-ready application.
